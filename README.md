# OLLA

OLLA (Optimizing the Lifetime and Location of Arrays) makes it possible to train larger deep neural networks on existing hardware. OLLA optimizes the order in which the neural network operators are executed to minimize peak memory usage. Furthermore OLLA eliminates memory fragmentation to ensure that no memory is wasted.

## Approach
 
Our approach is described in detail on the [OLLA arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12924)

## Getting Started

The source code will be available soon.
